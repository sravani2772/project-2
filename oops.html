	            <p>Factory -		It is an object to create other objects. </p>
	            <p>Instantiation -	When a class of object may be defined. All objects of this class 
	                have a certain set of properties, accessories, and methods. An
	                instance of that object is declared and the process is called   
	                instantiation. 
	    </p>
	

	            <p>Object -		An encapsulation of data along with functions that act upon that 
	                data.
	    </p>
	             <p>Class -			A blueprint for objects. A class is a user-defined type that 
	                describes what a certain type of object will look like. A 
	                class description consists of a declaration and a definition.
	    </p>
	            <p>Namespace -	A namespace is a collection of objects ("names") which has an 
	                associated mapping from its names to other objects.
	    </p>
	            <p>Constructor -	A constructor is a special method of a class or structure that 
	                initializes a newly created object of that type. Whenever 
	                an object is created, the constructor is called automatically.
	    </p>
	            <p>Fixture -		It is sample data. It allows you to populate your testing database 
	                with predefined data before your tests run. 
	    </p>
	            <p>Type Hint -		Is method by which we can force function to accept the desired 
	                data type. 
	    </p>
	            <p>Type Casting -	Is a method of changing an entity from one data type to 
	                another. 
	    </p>
	            <p>Unit Test -		Are typically written and run by software developers to ensure 
	                that code meets its design and behaves as intended.
	    </p>
	    <p>Class Method -	Are methods that are called on a class rather than an instance. </p>
	    <p>Facade -		Is a software-design pattern.</p>     
	    <p>Method -		A procedure associated with a message and an object.</p>
